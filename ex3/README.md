# Instagram Clone UI

## Description
I thought the instagram profile page lacked a bit of finness so I thought I would give it a more modern look and bring it up to the times. So I found this design on Dribble and re-created with Vue and Vuetify. 

The end result is what your see in the project [here](https://uzirthapa.github.io/instagram-clone/)
